# Particle In Cell - Electrostatic model

Simple 1D solver working toward a particle-in-cell (PIC) model
for plasma simulations.

## Model assumptions

Uses uniform Rho, Diriclet (0V boundary conditions) for electric field model.


## Sources

This is a rust implementation of the earliest model from the book "Plasma Simulations by Example" by Brieda.


## Execution

To run:
```bash
cargo run
